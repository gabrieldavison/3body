# TODO

## Concrete

- Add a qsm for graphics
- Add a command to clear the memory so you dont have to restart every time
- patterns with one note dont work 


## Abstract

- create an abstraction over message sending so you dont have different words for each messages type
- THink about how you can create patterns with mor interesting timing E.g. triplets, micro timing, other time signiatures
- Rethink how you do quoting and execution time computation 
    - I dont think this should belong in the Nod
- Can you use the stack and word chaning to do more interesting things
- Can you use live word definition to do more interesting things
- think about how the stack based paradigm could transfer in a better way to graphics programming
