# TODO

## Concrete

- patterns with one note dont work 
- doesnt work in a nice way
- come up with a way to change the output of a sequence
- pull the client into this repo so that its easier to start



## Abstract

- create an abstraction over message sending so you dont have different words for each messages type
- THink about how you can create patterns with mor interesting timing E.g. triplets, micro timing, other time signiatures
- Rethink how you do quoting and execution time computation 
    - I dont think this should belong in the Nod
- Can you use the stack and word chaning to do more interesting things
- Can you use live word definition to do more interesting things
- think about how the stack based paradigm could transfer in a better way to graphics programming
- create an abstraction over message sending so the message output doesnt care if it is sending SSE's or OSC
